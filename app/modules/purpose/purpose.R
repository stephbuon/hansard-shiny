                                            Users of our prototype application can use an array of data-mining and statistical tools to explore the evolution and nature of political language as it occurs in different time periods, across different speakers, and in different national contexts. 
                                            Citizens using our toolset can navigate from an overview showing change over time, to a depiction of how different candidates talk about the same issue, to the in-text mentions of word use that a computer has used to produce the visualizations in question.",

                                            The usefulness of any application for citizens to understand democracy depends upon how much they can trust the data and its analysis. 
                                            For users to trust the analysis, an app must cut a line between transparency, precision, and innovation. 
                                            Our tool does this by employing methods such as word counts, tf-idf measures, topic models, word embeddings, and triples analysis. 
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            In general, our appâ€™s design will try to compensate for user mistrust of algorithm- and algebra- dependent measures by linking visualizations to the citations that explain each algorithm or measure and links in lay language. We will also privilege certain measures -- for instance triples analysis, a tool that is simultaneously transparent, precise, and sensitive.")
